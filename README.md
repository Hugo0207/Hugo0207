## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hugo Girard**. I am a **computer science** student at INSA Toulouse and University of QuÃ©bec at Chicoutimi. I have learned a lot of things on general and computer science. I am currently learning how to develop video games :video_game: My goal is to work in the video game industry.

On this GitHub, you will find some of my school, internship, and personal projects. It contains the repositories I could publish.



Video game projects:
PewPewTime - UQAC school project - Unreal Engine
CURV - CNES internship project - React/ThreeJS
BEANIGHT - Jame Gam #29 - Unity
Laisse moi jouer Ã  mon jeu ! - WonderJam Fall 2024 - Unreal Engine
